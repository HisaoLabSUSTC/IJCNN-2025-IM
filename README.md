# An Inverse Model-based Solution Generation Method for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms (IJCNN 2025)

## This repository provides:
- Related codes for the inverse model-based solution generation method in the paper.
- Modified versions of four evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms based on these codes.


## Usage:
1. Install MATLAB ([![MATLAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MATLAB-R2024b-blue)](https://www.mathworks.com)) and PlatEMO ([![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-PlatEMO-orange)](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO)). 
2. Copy the folder "IM_algorithms" to the PlatEMO
3. Use these four modified algorithms as you like. You can also embed our inverse model-based solution generation method in other algorithms.
