# An Inverse Model-based Solution Generation Method for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms

%%This repository provides:
- The codes for the inverse model-based solution generation method.
- Modified versions of four evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms (Based on the above codes).

%%Useage:
1. Install PlatEMO
2. Copy the folder "IM_algorithms" to the PlatEMO
3. Use these modified algorithms as you like. You can also embed our inverse model-based solution generation method in other algorithms.
